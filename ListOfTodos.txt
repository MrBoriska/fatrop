1) Latent Stage Variables
importance -, methodolical difficulty --, implementational difficulty -
remarks: efficient solution of DAE's

2) Small Dense solver 
importance -, methodolical difficulty --, implementational difficulty --

3) Feasibility Restoration Phase
importrance ++, methodolical difficulty ++, implementational difficulty ++
remarks: easy to implement inefficient version, possible to work step by step to efficient version

4) Support for optimization on Lie Manifolds
importance -, methodolical difficulty ++, implementational dificulty +

5) Better ocp specification + builder
importance ++, methodolical difficulty --, implementational dificulty -
remarks: currently the fatrop solver is able to solve a more broad class of optimal control problem than what is possible to specify in python and built by the associated builder class
