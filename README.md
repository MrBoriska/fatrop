# Upcoming release: new version

A new version of FATROP is on its way.  
The release is currently in the **beta phase** and available for preview in the [`fatropv1`](https://github.com/jgillis/fatrop_demo/tree/fatropv1) branch.  

# FATROP
Fatrop is a constrained nonlinear optimal control problem solver that is fast and achieves a high numerical robustness.

The main features of the solver are:
- high numerical robustness thanks to advanced numerical optimization techniques, inspired by [Ipopt](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/)
- fast by exploiting the optimal control problem structure through a specialized linear solver, based on a [generalized Riccati recursion](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oca.3064)
- effective handling of path equality and inequality constraints, without relying on penalty methods
- ability to incorporate exact Lagrangian Hessian information
- ability to be initialized from any, possibly infeasible, solution estimate

# Usage
- fatrop can be used using the "low-level" interface by implementing an OcpAbstract class. See fatrop/ocp/OCPAbstract.hpp
- fatrop is also interfaced with CasADi. A version without blasfeo CPU specialization is distributed through Pypi and conda. A usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/jgillis/fatrop_demo).
