# FATROP
Fatrop is a constrained nonlinear optimal control problem solver that is fast and achieves a high numerical robustness.

The main features of the solver are:
- high numerical robustness thanks to advanced numerical optimization techniques, inspired by [Ipopt](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/)
- fast by exploiting the optimal control problem structure through a specialized linear solver, based on a [generalized Riccati recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14836)
- effective handling of path equality and inequality constraints, without relying on penalty methods
- ability to incorporate exact Lagrangian Hessian information
- ability to be initialized from any, possibly infeasible, solution estimate
- interfaced to [rockit](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/meco-software/rockit), which is a high-level optimal control problem specification framework, built on top of [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/)

# Installation instructions
## (recursively) clone this repository
    git clone https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/robotgenskill/fatrop/fatrop.git --recursive
    cd fatrop

## build and install fatrop + fatropy
At this moment fatrop is only tested on (Ubuntu) Linux machines.

Set the CMake flags, change the blasfeo target to your system architecture (see table of https://github.com/giaf/blasfeo).

    export CMAKE_FLAGS="-DBLASFEO_TARGET=X64_AUTOMATIC -DENABLE_MULTITHREADING=OFF"

build and install the fatropy project

    cd fatropy 
    pip install .

Trouble shoot: make sure you have the newest version of pip and setuptools installed

    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## build and install fatrop (c++ only)
build and install the fatrop project

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DBLASFEO_TARGET=X64_AUTOMATIC ..
    make -j

if you want to install fatrop on your system: 
    sudo make install

for non-X64 targets change the blasfeo_target parameter according to the table of https://github.com/giaf/blasfeo

## install rockit with fatropy interface 

    git clone https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/meco-software/rockit.git
    git clone https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0110259/rockit_fatrop_plugin.git ./rockit/rockit/external/fatrop --recursive
    cd rockit
    pip install .
